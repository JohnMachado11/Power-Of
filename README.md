# Power-Of

The “Power Of” program does all the calculations required to raise any number to the power of any number. “Exponentiation” is what this operation is called and it does the correct calculations for every situation. 

Python has a built in function that does all this “pow()” but I wanted to build it myself. 😊 

Created with Python and uses the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) programming paradigm
